    Hello there!
    <br /><br />
    This is a test to see if the StaticFiles middleware is working
    properly.
    <br /><br />
    What about the client-side cache? Does it work or not?
    <br /><br />
    It seems like we can configure it: we disabled it during
    development, and enabled it in production!
